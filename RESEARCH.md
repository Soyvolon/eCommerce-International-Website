**Things of Note**  
- Kyoto is a compact city with a well-developed transport network. It’s very easy to get around.
- The subways and trains are the most convenient way to get around the city.
- Buses are less convenient, but cover almost the whole city.
- Taxis are plentiful and reasonably cheap. They’re sometimes cheaper than buses for groups of three or four on short trips.
- Bicycles are a great way to get around Kyoto. The city is mostly flat and the drivers are sane. If you enjoy cycling, I strongly recommend renting a bicycle to explore the city.
- Kyoto is a great city to explore on foot. Downtown area, Arashiyama and Higashiyama are all great for walking.
- There are several special tickets that will save you tons of money if you plan on riding the buses, subways and trains a lot.
