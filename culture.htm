			<h2>Cultural Differences</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Keeping your shoes on in certain places is highly offensive. Leaving your shoes on when entering someone's house is a major sign of disrespect. Like many other parts of Asia, removing your shoes when entering a home is an absolute must. This is also the norm for several restaurants, so be sure to check around if you should slip your shoes off or not. Oh, and you're going to have to take off your shoes before entering most dressing rooms, too.</li>
				<li>You don't need to tip. Speaking of restaurant etiquette, you don't need to tip in Japan. In fact, if you do, there's a big chance your server will run after you to give you the money you accidentally left behind. Waiters get paid a living wage in Japan, so don't feel guilty. This rule is also true for hotel staff and other service staff you'll encounter during your trip.</li>
				<li>Americans tend to be more direct and blunt, whereas Japanese people are more subtle. Being too direct in Japan can be considered rude. This can be seen in body language, too. People in the U.S. are taught to look directly in someone's eyes when speaking or listening to show they are actively participating in the conversation. In Japan, extended eye contact can be uncomfortable between people who aren't close, and eyes are often adverted. Japanese people also tend to be more reserved than Americans, and share less personal or sensitive information, often even with close friends.</li>
				<li>Japanese people tend to be more formal. Though well known that many Asian countries bow instead of shaking hands, Japanese people bow in more situations than just greetings. Bowing can be done in apologizing and thanking as well. Though in business people might bow deeply to a 45 degree angle, most bows are a casual bob of the head and slight incline of the back. However, Japanese people are well aware that foreigners usually shake hands and might readily offer their hands in greeting instead.</li>
				<li>In Japan, social hierarchy is important. The junior/senior relationship is very important in Japan. A company employee who is younger and probably hasn't worked at the company as long as his older coworker will be a "junior" to the "senior." It is the same for students, especially in school clubs. In theory, the senior is a mentor for the junior, and it is the junior's duty to help out the senior and the other members of the group. These roles aren't non-existent in America, but roles are often based on personal accomplishments, and they aren't always respected as a rule, either.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Local Food</h2>
			<h3>Rice</h3>
			<ul>
				<img src="food/rice.jpg" style="float:right;" height="auto" width="300px" />
				<li style="margin-right: 325px">Sticky, short-grained rice is the staple food in Japan. Uncooked rice is called kome. The cultivation of rice in paddy fields traditionally required great cooperation between villagers and this is said to have been central to the evolution of Japanese culture. Their are several thousand varieties grown in Japan, with Koshihikari and Akita Komachi being among the most popular. Rice is also used to make mochi (rice cakes), senbei (rice crackers) and sake (rice wine). Rice can also be cooked with red beans (sekihan), seafood and vegetables (Takikomi gohan) or as a kind of watery porridge seasoned with salt (kayu) which is very popular as a cold remedy. Onigiri are rice balls with seafood or vegetables in the middle, usually wrapped in a piece of dried seaweed (nori). They are traditionally part of a packed lunch or picnic. Individually wrapped onigiri, usually a trianular shape, make a good snack and are available at convenience stores.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 style="margin-top: 125px">Udon</h3>
			<ul>
				<img src="food/udon.jpg" style="float:right;" height="auto" width="300px" />
				<li>Udon noodles are made from wheat flour. They are boiled and served in a broth, usually hot but occasionally cold in summer, and topped with ingredients such as a raw egg to make tsukimi udon, and deep-fried tofu aburaage to make kitsune udon.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 style="margin-top: 180px;">Soba</h3>
			<ul>
				<img src="food/soba.jpg" style="float:right;" height="auto" width="300px" />
				<li>Soba is buckwheat noodles, which are thinner and a darker color than udon. Soba is usually served cold (zaru soba) with a dipping sauce, sliced green onions and wasabi. When served in a hot broth, it is known as kake soba. Served with the same toppings as udon, you get tsukimi soba, kitsune soba and tempura soba.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 style="margin-top: 200px">Ramen</h3>
			<ul>
				<img src="food/ramen.jpg" style="float:right;" height="auto" width="300px" />
				<li>While udon and soba are also believed to have come from China, only ramen retains its image as Chinese food. Ramen is thin egg noodles which are almost always served in a hot broth flavored with shoyu or miso. This is topped with a variety of ingredients such as slices of roast pork (chashu), bean sprouts (moyashi), sweetcorn and butter. Ramen is popular throughout Japan and different regions are known for their variations on the theme. Examples are Corn-butter Ramen in Sapporo and Tonkotsu Ramen in Kyushu. Instant ramen (the most famous brand is Pot Noodles), to which you just add hot water, has become very popular in recent years. </li>
			</ul>
			<h3 style="margin-top: 140px">Seafood and Meat</h3>
			<ul>
				<img src="food/seafood.jpg" style="float:right;" height="auto" width="300px" />
				<li>Japanese people consume a lot more fish than is typical in western countries and this is said to be a major factor in the country's relatively low rate of heart disease. Seafood is eaten in just about any form you can imagine, from raw sushi and sashimi to grilled sweetfish and clams. The spread of Â¥100 kaitenzushi (conveyor belt sushi) restaurants has made sushi into a homegrown fast-food that offsets some of the influence of imports like McDonalds.Many people are surprised to learn that meat consumption was illegal in Japan until the ban was lifted during the Meiji Restoration in the 1870s. As the country opened up to western culture, eating habits also began to change. Now meat is increasingly part of the everyday Japanese diet, with yakitori (grilled chicken), yakiniku (Korean barbeque), gyudon (beef bowl) and of course the standard fare of foreign and local hamburger chain restaurants ubiquitous across the country. This has led to an increase in related health problems, though the Japanese still maintain their position as the world's longest-living people. </li>
